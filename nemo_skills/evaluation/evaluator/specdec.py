    This evaluator receives speculative decoding statistics that were computed
    by :class:`SpecdecGenerationTask` using a before/after delta of the
    server's Prometheus ``/metrics`` counters.

    It stamps each data point in the output JSONL with the computed metrics so
    that the downstream :class:`SpecdecMetrics` class can aggregate them.

    Metrics stamped onto each data point:

    * ``acceptance_length`` — ``1 + delta_accepted / delta_drafts``
    * ``acceptance_rate`` — ``(delta_accepted / delta_draft_tokens) * 100``
    * ``num_drafts`` — number of draft rounds during this run
    * ``draft_tokens`` — total draft tokens proposed during this run
    * ``accepted_tokens`` — total tokens accepted during this run
    * ``per_position_acceptance_rates`` — list of per-position acceptance
      probabilities
