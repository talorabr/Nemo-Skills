        """Add average, standard deviation and standard error metrics.

        Only processes data when self.max_k > 1 and sample data is available in self.all_scores.

        Adds four statistical metrics:
        - {score_method}_avg: Average of metric values
        - {score_method}_std_dev_across_runs: Standard deviation of average metric values across runs
        - {score_method}_std_err_across_runs: Standard error of average metric values across runs
        - {score_method}_avg_sample_std_dev: Average of per-sample standard deviations

        Computes two complementary variance measures:

        1. std_dev_across_runs: Standard deviation of average metric values across runs
           - Each "run" uses attempt i from each sample (transpose of data)
           - Measures: "How much does the average metric value vary between different runs?"
           - std_err_across_runs: std_dev_across_runs / sqrt(k) where k is number of runs

        2. avg_sample_std_dev: Average of per-sample standard deviations
           - For each sample, calculates standard deviation across its k attempts, then averages
           - Measures: "What's the average within-sample variance?"

        Only adds columns to pass@1[avg-of-{k}] that must exist in the passed metrics_dict.

        Example (max_k=4):
            3 samples × 4 attempts = [[1,0,1,0], [1,1,0,0], [0,1,1,1]]

            Standard deviation and error of average metric values across runs (transpose):
            - Run 1: [1,1,0] → avg 0.6667
            - Run 2: [0,1,1] → avg 0.6667
            - Run 3: [1,0,1] → avg 0.6667
            - Run 4: [0,0,1] → avg 0.3333
            → std_dev_across_runs = stdev([0.6667, 0.6667, 0.6667, 0.3333]) ≈ 0.1925
            → std_err_across_runs = 0.1925 / sqrt(4) ≈ 0.096

            Average of per-sample standard deviations:
            - Sample 1: stdev([1,0,1,0]) ≈ 0.5773
            - Sample 2: stdev([1,1,0,0]) ≈ 0.5773
            - Sample 3: stdev([0,1,1,1]) ≈ 0.5000
            → avg_sample_std_dev = (0.5773 + 0.5773 + 0.5000) / 3 ≈ 0.5515
