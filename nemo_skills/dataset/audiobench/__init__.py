"""AudioBench: A comprehensive benchmark for speech and audio language models.

AudioBench evaluates models across multiple tasks:
- ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)
- Translation (speech-to-text translation)
- Speech QA (question answering based on audio)
- Audio understanding (emotion, gender, accent recognition, etc.)

The benchmark is organized into two main categories:
- nonjudge: Tasks evaluated with automatic metrics (WER, BLEU)
- judge: Tasks requiring LLM-as-a-judge evaluation
